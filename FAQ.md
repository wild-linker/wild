## Why another linker?

Mold is already very fast, however it doesn't do incremental linking and the author has stated that
they don't intend to. Wild doesn't do incremental linking yet, but that is the end-goal. By writing
Wild in Rust, it's hoped that the complexity of incremental linking will be achievable.

## How can I verify that Wild was used to link a binary?

Install `readelf` (available from binutils package), then run:

```sh
readelf --string-dump .comment my-executable
```

Look for a line like:

```
Linker: Wild version 0.1.0
```

You can probably also get away with `strings` (also available from binutils package):

```sh
strings my-executable | grep 'Linker:'
```

## Where did the name come from?

It's somewhat of a tradition for linkers to end with the letters "ld". e.g. "GNU ld, "gold", "lld",
"mold". Since the end-goal is for the linker to be incremental, an "I" is added. Let's say the "W"
stands for "Wild", since recursive acronyms are popular in open-source projects.
